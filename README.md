# 3D Printable Modular Drawers

Look closer into the future. 3D printing is a field that brings a lot of versatility and innovations. Always wanted to get that something for your desk and never found something right? Functional and yet so decorative, this 3D printed drawer is what might make your time at home a little more creative and give you just that item you were looking for your desk and CREATED from the comfort of your own home. Moreover, it's a handy item to have to help you with your Spring cleaning and store tiny items. 3D Printable Modular Drawers is a simple and scalable open-source Desk Organiser project.

This project is a modified version of [VMI](https://www.thingiverse.com/vmi/about)'s [Multi Box Storage System](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2791077) project on Thingiverse.

## How to print.

You can use my Cura profile from the project folder if you want to use my settings with Creality Ender-3 printer which I tried and tested to get the perfect balance of good quality and less time consuming print.

Go ahead and feel free to experiment with your own settings to see what gives you the perfect results.

You can follow the [Instructables project](https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Modular-Desk-Organisers/) for detailed instructions.

>Note: All the instructions and Cura Profile is for Creality Ender-3 Printer you might need to tweak the settings based on your printer.
