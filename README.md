Functional and yet so decorative, this 3D printed drawer is what might make your time at home a little more creative and give you just that item you were looking for your desk and CREATED from the comfort of your own home. Moreover, it's a handy item to have to help you with your Spring cleaning and store tiny items. 3D Printable Modular Drawers is a simple and scalable open-source Desk Organiser project.
